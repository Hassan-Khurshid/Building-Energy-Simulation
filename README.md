# Building-Energy-Simulation
This is a an energy simulation project of the Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation building in Rutgers. 

It uses building floor plans that were the basis for 3-D model constructed in Sketchup.
The 3-D model was exported to OpenStudio wherein energy simulations were run after incorporating for building schedules, HVAC systems, electrical appliances, etc.
The software gave an energy consumption report including Energy Use Intensity and other useful outputs to check for possible avenues of energy savings in this particular building.
